        <section>
          <p>
            I am a consumer behavior specialist with a passion for data-driven
            marketing, customer-oriented solutions as well as creative tasks. I
            love to develop new projects and to proceed from concept to action.
            With eight years of experience in marketing research and over ten
            years of experience in the wine and spirits practice, I strive to
            discover what it takes to create digital customer experiences.
            Besides, you find me either exploring music and the latest podcasts
            on Spotify, discovering the world (currently mainly from the
            kitchen), restoring old furniture or on my yoga mat.
